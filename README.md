# Image-Genie
"Image-Genie lets you upload and edit images with CSS effects. Get the base64 code embedded into an <img> and CSS properties for your modified image to easily integrate it into your web projects.You can also simply upload image and convert it into base64 code."

As a novice web developper,this project is my first serious web application and was an exercice to upgrade my Javascript skills( no frameworks) and be forced to face reccurents issues in a web project.

Image-Genie v0.9b has been developped in 6weeks, main goal was 4weeks...the application still needs improvement,better structure and more options. I wil improve it further with next updates.
