"Image-Genie lets you upload and edit images with CSS effects. Get the base64 code embedded into an <img> and CSS properties for your modified image to easily integrate it into your web projects.You can also simply upload image and convert it into base64 code."
As a novice web developper,this project is my first web application and was an exercice to upgrade my Javascript skills( no frameworks) and be forced to face reccurents issues in a web project.
